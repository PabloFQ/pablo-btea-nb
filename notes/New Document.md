## Myostatin 

by Pablo Fuentes


-------

Is a growth factor that regulates the size of muscles beginning in early embryonic development and continuing throughout life. Myostatin acts by inhibiting the growth of muscles, It prevents them from growing too large. A number of studies shown this genes are present in the most of vertebrates and in many species have a significant regulation role with growth functions. Therefore is a very interesting candidate gene for the improvement of aquaculture productivity.
